# CS326 ctrlelite: Rentern

### Team Overview

* Conlan Cesar           ([@HeroCC](https://github.com/HeroCC))
* Benjamin Tufano        ([@tufanobenjamin](https://github.com/tufanobenjamin))
* Liam Neal Reilly       ([@lhnealreilly](https://github.com/lhnealreilly))
* Yichong Liu            ([@YiChong_Liu](https://github.com/YiChong-Liu))

### Innovative Idea
Our idea is to design and implement a corporate roommate finder — for example, if you are offered a new job and need to relocate, under such circumstances you are looking for new roommates to rent a house, you can sign up for our website by a certain username and a password, specify where you’re working and which company, as well as a bunch of other preferential information (housing type, age/gender preference, college alumni, sleep schedule, cleanliness, and budget), and the website will provide a few recommended matches so they can chat and potentially become roommates. As an optional stretch goal, the website could also suggest a few available apartments or homes in the area. There are existing applications for finding roommates, but neither focus their searches on interns / new-grads, nor based on a specific company they work for.

### Important Components
The important components we plan to implement are

* **User profile** (a profile that contains personal information which will be used to match others)  
* **Direct Messaging System** to allow matches to talk to each other.  
* **A home page with user data displayed**
* **A page to approve or reject roommate matches**
* **A page to view all currently matched roommates**. 
* **A system to suggest nice apartments in user's demand to the roommate pairs.**
