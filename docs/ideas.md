### Innovative Idea
Our idea is for a corporate roommate finder — for example, if you go on an internship and need to find a roommate, you’ll sign up for our website by a certain username and a strong password, specify where you’re working and which company, as well as a bunch of other preferential information (housing type, diet, sleep schedule, cleanliness, and budget), and we will give a few recommended matches so they can chat and potentially become roommates. As an optional stretch goal, we could also suggest a few available apartments or homes in the area. There are existing applications for finding roommates, but none focus their search on interns / new-grads, nor based on a company they work for.

### Important Components
The important components we plan on implementing are a user profile system, a system that matches users based on the user profiles, and possibly a basic direct messaging system to allow matches to talk to each other. Some of the pages will include a home page with user data displayed, a page to approve or reject roommate matches, and a page to view all currently matched roommates. After matching you can block/remove a match or accept a roommate. If possible we may implement a system to suggest apartments in the right area/budget to roommate pairs.
