# CS326 Team 8: ctrlelite - The Rentern
### **Spring 2022**

## Overview

Our project is to design and implement a corporate roommate finder â€” for example, if you are offered a new job and need to relocate, under such circumstances you are looking for new roommates to rent a house, you can sign up for our website by a valid email account and a password, specify the user preferences including housing location, housing type, age/gender preference, sleep schedule, cleanliness, and things to share, etc. And the website will provide recommended matches so they can send interests, chat and potentially become roommates.

### API Endpoints

##### PUT /api/users/newUser:

Create a new user in the Rentern database. Arguments required: Email, Password.

Query Parameters: Email, Password

Requires JWT authentication: FALSE

Example API call:
```
await fetch('/api/users/newUser',
    {
        method: 'PUT'
        body:
        {
            email: 'name@user.com',
            password: '1234'
        }
    });
```
Response:
```
{
    "worked" : true,
    "email" : "name@user.com",
    "password" : "1234"
}
```
If accepted is false, the user was not created. Likely because there exists a user in the database with the email already created.

---

##### PUT /api/matches/acceptMatch

Attempts to accept a match betwen 2 users. It checks if a match has already been initilized (by the other user) and accepts if so. If not it initializes a match in the database that can be accepted by the other user.

Query Parameters: user, user2

Requires JWT authentication: TRUE

Example API call:
```
await fetch('/api/matches/acceptMatch',
    {
        method: 'PUT'
        {
            user : 123,
            user2 : 87654321
        }
    });
```
Response:
```
{
    "worked" : true,
    "user2" : 87654321
}
```
If worked is false, the other user has not accepted the match yet. A match is created, but flagged as partially accepted.

### URL  Routes/Mappings




### Authentication and Authorization

We decided, rather than using state in the backend, to use JSON-Web-Tokens. This allows us to restart our backend or loadbalance to different nodes, without needing to manage the state of the user's login in the background.

When a user logs in or registers, the page makes a request to those API endpoints (these are the only endpoints that don't require authentication). If the request is valid, we send back a new cookie with a cryptographically secure value, which when decoded, contains the user's ID. The client can attempt to modify this value, but we can verify its authenticity in the backend, so it is not possible to simply log in as another user.

Further requests contain the cookie, which the backend verifies is secure and non-expired. If the user is allowed, the proper data is returned, otherwise throwing an HTTP 401 error.

All users have the same privileges basic -- there is no concept of an admin or super user. All registered users are visible in the profile matching page. Only you are allowed to upload your new profile information or change your preferences.

### Conclusion

Yichong Liu: Throughout this project, I learned how to make websites look more beautiful, heroku deployment and how to cooperate with back-end colleagues to meet specific needs. The overall experience is great! And I'm looking forward to finish and improve the matching algorithm, and learn more about web programming in the future! \
Liam Neal Reilly: Although I had experience with many of the concepts such as SQL, html, js etc. The process of building and deploying an website from start to finish with a team was a great learning experience.
