## The Rentern

### Spring 2022

### Overview

Our project is to design and implement a corporate roommate finder â€” for example, if you are offered a new job and need to relocate, under such circumstances you are looking for new roommates to rent a house, you can sign up for our website by a valid email account and a password, specify the user preferences including housing location, housing type, age/gender preference, sleep schedule, cleanliness, and things to share, etc. And the website will provide recommended matches so they can send interests, chat and potentially become roommates.
